Eventually planning to set up SMS to open my apartment door.  For now just organizing the project a bit from the pygooglevoice API.

Note:  Need BeautifulSoup python libraries installed so it can be imported.

Note:  To automate API requests you will need a file in your home directory called .gvoice of the same formatas the gvoice.config file.

Running an example script:
1. Put the script one level above the googlevoice/ directory.  It is expecting the python libs inside of googlevoice/ to be in place.  Alternatively, fix the imports.

Example Project Structure:

examples/
googlevoice/
gvoice.config
parse_sms.py
